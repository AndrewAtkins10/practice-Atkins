I really want to visit France becaus eof lot of my teammates are from there. They also have a very rich culture for being surrounded by countries. Really, I want to go to most of Europe, I just know frnce would be easiest becuase I could stay with one of my teammates free of charge and tickets from France to neighboring countries are very cheap, so if I wanted to go to Turkey, Italy, or Austria, France would be a good first stop.
